# Toan Machine

Toan Machine is a tool to assist with training a model for use with [Neural Amp Modeler](https://www.neuralampmodeler.com/).

It will provide users with a simple step-by-step process to both record a pedal and train a model based on that recording.

Initially this will be Mac-exclusive as it will use Apple's MLX library for the neural net training. Support for other platforms may come eventually.
